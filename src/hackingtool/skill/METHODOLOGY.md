# Operator Methodology Playbook (2026)

Reference for the AI planner: canonical, actively-maintained tools a professional
reaches for at each engagement phase, loaded at build time as a static file (the
runtime AI never browses the web — it only reads this). Each tool is marked
**active** (touches/sends packets to the target) or **passive** (OSINT / no
direct interaction) — load-bearing for constraints like "without hitting the
server." Authorized-testing framing throughout; no destructive/DoS/mass-target
tooling included.

## 1. Recon — passive OSINT (subdomains, ASN, emails, leaks)
- **theHarvester** (passive) — emails, subdomains, hosts from search engines/PGP/Shodan-Censys aggregation — `install: pipx install theHarvester`
- **crt.sh / Certificate Transparency** (passive) — enumerate issued certs to reveal subdomains, no direct target contact — `install: none (web/curl query)`
- **Shodan CLI** (passive) — pre-indexed banners/service history for a target ASN or IP — `install: pipx install shodan`
- **Censys CLI** (passive) — pre-indexed host/cert data, complementary coverage to Shodan — `install: pipx install censys`
- **whois / ASN lookup (bgp.he.net, ARIN/RIPE)** (passive) — org-to-ASN-to-IP-range mapping before any scanning — `install: none (whois preinstalled or apt install whois)`

## 2. Subdomain / asset discovery
- **subfinder** (passive) — fast passive subdomain enum from ~30+ public sources, the default first pass — `install: go install github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest`
- **amass** (passive by default, active with `-active`) — deepest passive source coverage plus optional active DNS/brute-force enum — `install: go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master`
- **assetfinder** (passive) — quick, no-API-key subdomain/related-domain baseline — `install: go install github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder@latest`
- **bbot** (passive/active modes) — modular OSINT recon framework, correlates infra relationships beyond flat subdomain lists — `install: pipx install bbot`

## 3. DNS resolution & probing
- **dnsx** (active, low-touch) — bulk resolve subdomains to live A/AAAA/CNAME records, filter dead hosts before further work — `install: go install github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/cmd/dnsx@latest`
- **httpx** (active, low-touch) — probe resolved hosts for live HTTP(S), title/status/tech-stack fingerprinting — `install: go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest`
- **katana** (active) — headless-capable crawler for JS-heavy apps, feeds URLs into fuzzing/vuln scanning — `install: go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest`

## 4. Port/service scanning
Active:
- **nmap** (active) — the standard for deep service/version/OS detection and NSE scripting on a focused target set — `install: apt install nmap` (or `brew install nmap`)
- **naabu** (active) — fast Go port scanner built to pipe into the rest of the ProjectDiscovery chain — `install: go install github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu@latest`
- **masscan** (active) — internet-scale SYN scanning across huge IP ranges, no service detection — `install: apt install masscan`
- **rustscan** (active) — very fast full-range port discovery that auto-pipes results into nmap for depth — `install: brew install rustscan`

Passive:
- **Shodan** (passive) — historical/pre-scanned open-port and banner data with zero packets to target — `install: pipx install shodan`
- **Censys** (passive) — same category as Shodan; broader cert/host correlation — `install: pipx install censys`

## 5. Web content discovery / fuzzing
- **ffuf** (active) — most versatile Go fuzzer: directories, params, vhosts, POST bodies — `install: go install github.com/ffuf/ffuf/v2@latest`
- **feroxbuster** (active) — Rust recursive content discovery, strong default recursion + robots.txt parsing — `install: cargo install feroxbuster` (or `apt install feroxbuster`)
- **gobuster** (active) — simple, very fast dir/DNS/vhost brute-forcer, good quick first sweep — `install: go install github.com/OJ/gobuster/v3@latest`
- **dirsearch** (active) — friendly, well-maintained Python alternative for straightforward runs — `install: pipx install dirsearch`

## 6. Web vulnerability scanning
- **nuclei** (active) — template-based scanner (9,000+ community templates), fastest path from recon output to known-CVE/misconfig hits; scanner output is a lead, not a finding — needs manual confirmation — `install: go install github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest`
- **nikto** (active) — classic web-server misconfig/outdated-software scanner, good complementary sanity pass — `install: apt install nikto` (or `brew install nikto`)
- Pipeline: `subfinder | dnsx | httpx | nuclei` is the standard chain; `httpx -silent | nuclei -t <templates>` is the common web-vuln step.

## 7. Specific web exploitation
- **sqlmap** (active) — canonical automated SQL-injection detection/exploitation across MySQL/PostgreSQL/MSSQL/etc. — `install: apt install sqlmap`
- **dalfox** (active) — modern Go XSS scanner: reflected/stored/DOM detection, WAF-aware, pipes well into recon output — `install: go install github.com/hahwul/dalfox/v2@latest`
- **XSStrike** (active) — parser-driven XSS detection with intelligent payload generation, complements Dalfox — `install: git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike && pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 8. Credential attacks / password cracking
*Authorization-sensitive: online guessing can lock out accounts or trip alerting; only run within signed scope.*
- **hydra** (active) — network logon brute-forcer across FTP/SSH/HTTP/RDP/etc., the default online cracker — `install: apt install hydra`
- **medusa** (active) — thread-based parallel logon cracker, more stable against slow/flaky services — `install: apt install medusa`
- **hashcat** (offline, no target contact) — GPU-accelerated hash cracking, mask/rule-based attacks — `install: brew install hashcat` (or `apt install hashcat`)
- **John the Ripper** (offline, no target contact) — CPU-based hash/format auto-detection cracker, strong for archives/docs — `install: apt install john`

## 9. Network / Active Directory
*Authorization-sensitive: these tools capture credentials/traffic and can disrupt AD auth flows — lab or explicit-scope only.*
- **NetExec (nxc)** (active) — the current CrackMapExec successor; SMB/WinRM/LDAP/MSSQL/RDP enum, spraying, and BloodHound collection in one tool — `install: pipx install netexec`
- **Impacket** (active) — scripts behind nearly every AD attack (secretsdump, GetUserSPN, GetTGT, ntlmrelayx) — `install: pipx install impacket`
- **BloodHound CE** (active collection, passive-ish graph analysis) — ingests AD relationships via SharpHound (Windows) or bloodhound-ce-python (Linux), visualizes attack paths to Domain Admin — `install: docker compose -f https://ghst.ly/getbhce up` (server); `pipx install bloodhound-ce` (Linux collector)
- **Responder** (active) — LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS poisoning for initial credential capture — `install: apt install responder`

## 10. Cloud
- **prowler** (active, read-only API calls) — broadest AWS/Azure/GCP CSPM checks with compliance-framework mapping — `install: pipx install prowler`
- **trivy** (active/local) — container image, IaC (Terraform), and filesystem vulnerability/misconfig scanning — `install: brew install trivy`
- **checkov** (passive, static analysis) — IaC scanning (Terraform/CloudFormation/Kubernetes) pre-deployment, broadest built-in policy coverage — `install: pipx install checkov`
- Note: ScoutSuite is now read-only/archived (last release Sep 2024) — prefer Prowler + Checkov + Trivy for a current stack.

## 11. Wireless
*Legally sensitive: capturing handshakes/PMKIDs or deauthing clients requires written authorization and is illegal against networks you don't own/aren't scoped to test.*
- **aircrack-ng suite** (active) — airodump-ng/aireplay-ng/aircrack-ng for capture, injection, and WPA/WPA2 key recovery — `install: apt install aircrack-ng`
- **hcxdumptool / hcxtools** (active) — modern PMKID/EAPOL capture with broader adapter/6GHz support — `install: apt install hcxtools hcxdumptool`
- **wifite** (active) — automated wrapper that drives aircrack-ng/hcxtools for broad, minimal-interaction sweeps — `install: apt install wifite`

## 12. Vulnerability scanning — general
- **nuclei** (active) — fast, template-driven, best for web/API surfaces and CI/CD-integrated scanning — `install: go install github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest`
- **OpenVAS / Greenbone (GVM)** (active) — comprehensive authenticated host/network vulnerability scanning (160k+ NVTs), heavier and slower than Nuclei but broader infra depth — `install: apt install gvm` (or Greenbone Community Container via Docker)

## Methodology principles for the planner
- **Passive before active.** Exhaust OSINT/passive sources (crt.sh, Shodan, Censys, subfinder, amass passive) before any packet touches the target.
- **Least-intrusive first.** Resolve/probe (dnsx, httpx) before scanning (naabu/nmap) before fuzzing/exploiting (ffuf, nuclei, sqlmap).
- **Respect explicit user constraints.** "Without hitting the server" / "no active scanning" → passive-only tool set (Shodan, Censys, crt.sh, theHarvester, amass in passive mode). Never substitute an active tool when passive was requested.
- **Chain via files, not memory.** Standard pipelines pass output through files/stdout (`subfinder -silent | dnsx -silent | httpx -silent | nuclei`) so each stage is independently inspectable.
- **Scanner output is a lead, not a finding.** Especially nuclei/nikto/OpenVAS hits need manual confirmation before being reported as a vulnerability.
- **Flag authorization-sensitive categories explicitly.** Credential attacks, AD tooling, and wireless capture should be called out as requiring signed scope/rules-of-engagement — never assume blanket authorization.
- **Never fabricate a tool.** If no canonical tool fits the ask, say so rather than inventing one — this file is the closed set the planner should draw from.
