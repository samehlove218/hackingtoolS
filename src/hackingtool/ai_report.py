"""AI4: draft a narrative engagement report from REAL findings only.

Product role: ``report.py`` renders a trustworthy facts-table; this drafts the
*narrative* a human actually hands off — an executive summary, methodology
(which pipelines ran), and per-finding impact/remediation. It is the payoff for
the bug-bounty / pentest / IR personas that the facts-table and the AI3 triage
blob don't give them.

It NEVER produces the facts: findings, severities, targets and tools come only
from the real data, rendered deterministically as an appendix
(``report.render_report``). The model writes prose *around* locked facts, so a
hijacked model can't add, hide, or re-severity a finding.

Security — this ingests untrusted, attacker-influenced scan output (a target
controls its own page titles, subdomains and banners, i.e. the ``name``/``raw``
fields). That is indirect prompt injection (OWASP LLM01). Defense in depth,
per the 2025 OWASP guidance:
  * facts stay deterministic — the model emits prose only;
  * findings are sanitized (control chars stripped) and wrapped in explicit
    ``<scan_data>`` delimiters that the system prompt marks as data, never
    instructions;
  * a groundedness check flags any URL host the narrative names that isn't in
    the real findings;
  * the draft is always labeled "AI-drafted / verify before use" and written to
    ``report.draft.md`` — it never overwrites the deterministic ``report.md``,
    and nothing here executes.
