"""Operator skill: the versioned charter + shared AI-safety helpers.

A pure leaf module — stdlib only, imports nothing from the ``ai_*`` features, so
every AI feature can prepend the same safety charter and reuse the same untrusted-
input hardening without a circular import.

``OPERATOR.md`` is both audiences in one file: a model-facing charter block
(between the ``charter:start``/``charter:end`` markers) and a human playbook below
it. It ships as package data (resolved via ``__file__``, like ``registry.py`` does
for ``catalog/*.yaml``). If it can't be read, ``charter()`` falls back to an
embedded floor that still carries the safety contract and the ``<scan_data>``
injection rule — the model is never invoked without safety instructions.
