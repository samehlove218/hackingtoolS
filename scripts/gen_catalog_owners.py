"""Regenerate src/hackingtool/catalog_owners.py from tools we already ship.

The owners of tools we curated are a free, self-maintaining trusted-author

from a malware toy, so we lean on who wrote the tools we already vetted.

Run: uv run python scripts/gen_catalog_owners.py
A test asserts the committed file matches a fresh run, so it cannot rot.
